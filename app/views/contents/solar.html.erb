							<p class="detailtext">
							 This means for around half of each day, solar panels are not producing energy for your home. Access to sunlight is limited at certain times (e.g. morning and night). Predicting overcast days can be difficult. This is why solar power is not our first choice when it comes to meeting the base load energy demand. However, solar power has fewer problems than wind power when it comes to intermittence.

							 Power density, or watt per square meter (W/m²), is essential when looking at how much power can be derived from a certain area of real estate of an energy source. Low power density indicates that too much real estate is required to provide the power we demand at reasonably prices. The global mean power density for solar radiation is 170 W/m². This is more than any other renewable energy source, but not comparable to oil, gas and nuclear power.

		<h2><a class="headerlink" href="http://www.rurdev.usda.gov/ORreap_renew_grants.html">USDA REAP Grants</a></h2>
		<p>
			The Department of Agriculture provides homeowners in rural areas with grants to buy and install solar energy systems. The grants can cover up to 25 percent of a project's total cost and are limited to $500,000 for solar energy systems. To qualify, you must own the home and be a farmer or a rancher in a rural area.
		</p>
		<h2>Green Retrofit Grants</h2>
		<p>
			HUD's Office of Affordable Housing Preservation pays eligible homeowners to install and maintain alternative energy technology such as solar energy systems. The program has total funding of $250 million and is sponsored by the Housing Recovery Act. You must spend grant funds within two years of receiving the money.
		</p>
		<h2>Federal Grant Program</h2>
		<p>
			The Department of Energy's Tribal Energy Program helps homeowners in tribal lands reach energy sufficiency through the use of renewable energy such as solar energy. The program helps you pay for the education, training, evaluation and development of solar energy resources.
		</p>
		<h2>Residential Renewable Energy Credit</h2>
		<p>
			The federal government allows you to claim a tax credit of up to 30 percent of your costs toward solar electric systems. To qualify, fuel cells must have a minimum of 0.5 kW, an electricity generation efficiency of at least 30 percent, and at least 50 percent of the home's heating energy must come from solar energy.

					This Solar & Wind Calculator will compute the size and cost to install an energy system for your home or building. Solar & wind calculator technology options include solar electric (PV), solar water heating, pool or spa heating, space heating & cooling, and wind turbines. The solar & wind calculator's financial analysis is based upon energy bill savings you can expect and the net system cost, after tax credits and other incentives are applied. The solar & wind calculator results are based upon many assumptions and the limited data you will enter. An actual site assessment by a trained professional solar & wind Contractor will be needed to determine the actual costs and benefits of installing a system.
