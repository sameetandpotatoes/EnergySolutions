		<h2>Green Retrofit Grants</h2>
		<p>
			HUD's Office of Affordable Housing Preservation pays eligible homeowners to install and maintain alternative energy technology such as solar energy systems. The program has total funding of $250 million and is sponsored by the Housing Recovery Act. You must spend grant funds within two years of receiving the money.
		</p>
		<h2>Federal Grant Program</h2>
		<p>
			The Department of Energy's Tribal Energy Program helps homeowners in tribal lands reach energy sufficiency through the use of renewable energy such as solar energy. The program helps you pay for the education, training, evaluation and development of solar energy resources.
		</p>
		<h2>Residential Renewable Energy Credit</h2>
		<p>
			The federal government allows you to claim a tax credit of up to 30 percent of your costs toward solar electric systems. To qualify, fuel cells must have a minimum of 0.5 kW, an electricity generation efficiency of at least 30 percent, and at least 50 percent of the home's heating energy must come from solar energy.

		<p>According to a recent analysis by Navigant Consulting, Inc. that compared the levelized cost of power from a number of electricity sources, hydropower was the most affordable at $.02/kWh (kilowatt hour). Hydropower’s levelized cost – which accounts for an energy-generating system’s lifetime costs such as initial investment, operations, maintenance and cost of fuel – even beats that of coal-fired power plants according to the study.</p>
		<p>The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.</p>
