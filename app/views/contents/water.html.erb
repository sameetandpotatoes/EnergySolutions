		<h2>Green Retrofit Grants</h2>
		<p>
			HUD's Office of Affordable Housing Preservation pays eligible homeowners to install and maintain alternative energy technology such as solar energy systems. The program has total funding of $250 million and is sponsored by the Housing Recovery Act. You must spend grant funds within two years of receiving the money.
		</p>
		<h2>Federal Grant Program</h2>
		<p>
			The Department of Energy's Tribal Energy Program helps homeowners in tribal lands reach energy sufficiency through the use of renewable energy such as solar energy. The program helps you pay for the education, training, evaluation and development of solar energy resources.
		</p>
		<h2>Residential Renewable Energy Credit</h2>
		<p>
			The federal government allows you to claim a tax credit of up to 30 percent of your costs toward solar electric systems. To qualify, fuel cells must have a minimum of 0.5 kW, an electricity generation efficiency of at least 30 percent, and at least 50 percent of the home's heating energy must come from solar energy.
